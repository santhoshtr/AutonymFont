Autonym Font
============

A font that can render all language autonyms.

If we want to show a large number of languages written in their own scripts
(autonyms), we cannot apply the usual webfonts to it. This is because when
each script requires a webfont, we will end up using a large number of
webfonts. This can cause large bandwidth usage.

An example of this use case is a language selector on a website.

Autonym font tries to solve this. The font contains glyphs and opentype rules
for rendering the language autonyms. And it contains only those glyphs for
a language. For example, for Thai, the font has glyphs required for
rendering ไทย alone.

The glyphs for the font is taken from a large number of free licensed fonts.
See CREDITS file for the full list.

pyftsubset tool from Behdad (https://github.com/behdad/fonttools) helped a lot
in the develpment of this font.

Fontforge is used as the font editing program.

Adding a new language autonym to this font
==========================================

Assuming you know basics of Automake, FontForge, OpenType rules, HarfBuzz etc.
(Sorry, font development is not that easy.)

1. Identify a font that has the glyphs for the new language autonym.
2. Important: The font should have a free license that allows reuse of the
glyphs. Don't violate any licenses. Give proper credits.
3. Use pyftsubset to subset the font.

```bash
pyftsubset FontName.ttf --text="YourLanguageAutonym"
```
4. This will create a new font named FontName.ttf.subset.
5. Open the Autonym font using fontforge. Merge the subset font to Autonym font
using Element->Merge fonts... option.
6. Run make test to test the newly added glyphs.

Making usable font files
========================

To make TTF, WOFF and EOT files that would be usable on your website,
you may use [sfntly](https://code.google.com/p/sfntly/).

The -h switch should not be used when creating the EOT version, as
it may cause rendering issues.
